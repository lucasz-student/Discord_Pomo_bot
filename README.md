# Discord Pomodoro Bot


## Introduction 
This is one of my python projects. I created a "discord bot" that helps you use the Pomodoro study method, also keeping you accountable and productive with a server scoreboard. Discord is a messaging platform; users can make voice and and video calls, send media and files in private communites called "guilds," or "servers." 

## Install and Details 
The server isn't constantly run on a cloud, but you can fork and change the source code. Here's the <a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1002018718320185375&permissions=8&scope=bot">link</a> to add Pomobot to your server.
