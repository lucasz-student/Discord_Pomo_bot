# Discord Pomodoro Bot


## Introduction 
<p>This is one of my python projects. I created a "discord bot" that helps you use the Pomodoro study method, also keeping you accountable and productive with a server scoreboard. Discord is a messaging platform; users can make voice and and video calls, send media and files in private communites called "guilds," or "servers."</p> 

## Install and Details 
<p>The server isn't constantly run on a cloud, but you can fork and change the source code. However, you have to create an application through the developer portal. Here's the link <a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1002018718320185375&permissions=8&scope=bot">to add PomoBot</a> to your server.</p>

<p>By default, the bot adds a study category to the server, which is required for the use of most commands. The bot applies the Pomodoro study method: you completely focus for 25 minutes, but get a 5 minute break afterward. This 30 minute session is 1 'Pomodoro.' After 4 pomodoros, you get a long break of 15 minutes.</p>
